Changes
~~~~~~~

  ``/api/v1/network-topology/``
  for consistency with the other OpenWISP Modules

  use the new URL: ``/api/v1/network-topology/topology/{id}/receive/``

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added support for Python 3.8 and Python 3.9
- Dropped support for Django 2.2

- Added the `openwisp-utils DjangoModelPermissions
  <https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-users#djangomodelpermissions>`_
  class to API views
- Allow nodes, link and topologies to be shared among different organizations

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~
