Quick Start Guide
=================

This module works by periodically collecting the network topology graph
data of the :ref:`supported networking software or formats
<network_topology_collectors>`. The data has to be either fetched by the
application or received in POST API requests, therefore after deploying
the application, additional steps are required to make the data collection
and visualization work, read on to find out how.

Creating a Topology
-------------------

1. Create a topology object by going to *Network Topology* > *Topologies*
   > *Add topology*.
2. Give an appropriate label to the topology.
3. Select the *topology format* from the dropdown menu. The *topology
   format* determines which parser should be used to process topology
   data.
4. Select the *Strategy* for updating this topology.

   - If you are using :ref:`FETCH strategy
     <network_topology_fetch_strategy>`, then enter the URL for fetching
     topology data in the *Url* field.
   - If you are using :ref:`RECEIVE strategy
     <network_topology_fetch_strategy>`, you will get the *URL* for
     sending topology data. The *RECEIVE* strategy provides an additional
     field *expiration time*. This can be used to add delay in marking
     missing links as down.

Sending Data for Topology with RECEIVE Strategy
-----------------------------------------------

    :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwisp/openwisp-network-topology/docs/docs/quickstart-receive.gif
    :align: center

1. Copy the *URL* generated by OpenWISP for sending the topology data.

   E.g., in our case the URL is
   ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/network-topology/topology/d17e539a-1793-4be2-80a4-c305eca64fd8/receive/?key=cMGsvio8q0L0BGLd5twiFHQOqIEKI423``.

   .. note::

       The topology receive URL is shown only after the topology object is
       created.

2. Create a script (e.g.: ``/opt/send-topology.sh``) which sends the
   topology data using ``POST``, in the example script below we are
   sending the status log data of OpenVPN but the same code can be applied
   to other formats by replacing ``cat /var/log/openvpn/tun0.stats`` with
   the actual command which returns the network topology output:

.. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/bash
    # replace COMMAND with the command used to fetch the topology data
    COMMAND="cat /var/log/openvpn/tun0.stats"
    UUID="<TOPOLOGY-UUID-HERE>"
    KEY="<TOPOLOGY-KEY-HERE>"
    OPENWISP_URL="https://<OPENWISP_DOMAIN_HERE>"
    $COMMAND |
        # Upload the topology data to OpenWISP
        curl -X POST \
            --data-binary @- \
            --header "Content-Type: text/plain" \
            $OPENWISP_URL/api/v1/network-topology/topology/$UUID/receive/?key=$KEY

3. Add the ``/opt/send-topology.sh`` script created in the previous step
   to the crontab, here's an example which sends the topology data every 5
   minutes:

.. code-block:: shell

    # flag script as executable
    chmod +x /opt/send-topology.sh
    # open crontab
    crontab -e

    ## Add the following line and save

    echo */5 * * * * /opt/send-topology.sh

4. Once the steps above are completed, you should see nodes and links
   being created automatically, you can see the network topology graph
   from the admin page of the topology change page (you have to click on
   the *View topology graph* button in the upper right part of the page)
   or, alternatively, a non-admin visualizer page is also available at the
   URL ``/topology/topology/<TOPOLOGY-UUID>/``.

Sending Data for ZeroTier Topology with RECEIVE Strategy
--------------------------------------------------------

Follow the procedure described below to setup ZeroTier topology with
RECEIVE strategy.

.. note::

    In this example, the **Shared systemwide (no organization)** option is
    used for the ZeroTier topology organization. You are free to opt for
    any organization, as long as both the topology and the device share
    the same organization, assuming the :doc:`OpenWISP controller
    integration <integrations>` feature is enabled.

1. Create Topology for ZeroTier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Visit ``admin/topology/topology/add`` to add a new topology.
2. We will set the **Label** of this topology to ``ZeroTier`` and select
   the topology **Format** from the dropdown as ``ZeroTier``.
3. Select the strategy as ``RECEIVE`` from the dropdown.

    :alt: ZeroTier topology configuration example 1

4. Let use default **Expiration time** ``0`` and make sure **Published**
   option is checked.
5. After clicking on the **Save and continue editing** button, a topology
   receive URL is generated. Make sure you copy that URL for later use in
   the topology script.

2. Create a Script for Sending ZeroTier Topology Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Now, create a script (e.g: ``/opt/send-zt-topology.sh``) that sends the
   ZeroTier topology data using a POST request. In the example script
   below, we are sending the ZeroTier self-hosted controller peers data:

.. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/bash
    # command to fetch zerotier controller peers data in json format
    COMMAND="zerotier-cli peers -j"
    UUID="<TOPOLOGY-UUID-HERE>"
    KEY="<TOPOLOGY-KEY-HERE>"
    OPENWISP_URL="https://<OPENWISP_DOMAIN_HERE>"
    $COMMAND |
        # Upload the topology data to OpenWISP
        curl -X POST \
            --data-binary @- \
            --header "Content-Type: text/plain" \
            $OPENWISP_URL/api/v1/network-topology/topology/$UUID/receive/?key=$KEY

2. Add the ``/opt/send-zt-topology.sh`` script created in the previous
   step to the root crontab, here's an example which sends the topology
   data every **5 minutes**:

.. code-block:: shell

    # flag script as executable
    chmod +x /opt/send-zt-topology.sh

.. code-block:: shell

    # open rootcrontab
    sudo crontab -e

    ## Add the following line and save

    echo */5 * * * * /opt/send-zt-topology.sh

.. note::

    When using the **ZeroTier** topology, ensure that you use ``sudo
    crontab -e`` to edit the **root crontab**. This step is essential
    because the ``zerotier-cli peers -j`` command requires **root
    privileges** for kernel interaction, without which the command will
    not function correctly.

3. Once the steps above are completed, you should see nodes and links
   being created automatically, you can see the network topology graph
   from the admin page of the topology change page (you have to click on
   the **View topology graph** button in the upper right part of the page)
   or, alternatively, a non-admin visualizer page is also available at the
   URL ``/topology/topology/<TOPOLOGY-UUID>/``.
